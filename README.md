# ANPR(Automatic Number Plate Recognition)
Automatic number-plate recognition is
a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration
plates to create vehicle location data. It can use existing closed-circuit television, road-rule enforcement cameras, 
or cameras specifically designed for the task. ANPR is used by police forces around the world for law enforcement purposes, 
including to check if a vehicle is registered or licensed.
It is also used for electronic toll collection on pay-per-use roads and as a method of cataloguing the movements of traffic.
